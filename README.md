Hi Folks!

I'm a Software Engineer working with software development at about 25 years, with experience in Educational and Finantial industries. I've been working with development of small and big platforms with thousand of requests per minute. Most of those developed under JVM, relational databases, hosted on-premisse and cloud.

Here I share my articles, experiences, tips/tricks, proof of concept and other stuffs that can help anyone (including me). So, it's a blog and a knowledge base.

You can reach me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/romulofpaiva) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romulofpaiva/).

I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to contact me.

Best Regards,
RÃ´mulo Ferreira Paiva.
