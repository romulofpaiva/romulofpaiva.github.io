# Object Oriented Programming

### Definition
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm of programming where the program is a collection of objects that represents real world entities.  

### Concepts
A *Class* is a template or a blueprint (e.g.: Car) of an *Object*. The *Object* represents the real world entity (e.g.: Jeep, Mustang, Porsche).

A *Class* is composed by *attributes* and *methods*. An *attribute* represents characteristics of the *Object* like "color" and the *method* represents behaviors of the *Object* like "accelerate", "break", "turn to left".

The *Object* is created or instanced from the *Class*. When an *Object* is created, it's saved in the computer memory. When it's not more used, the reserved memory is discarded.
