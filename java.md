## Java

Java is a multi-platform programming language. It means that it allows writing programs that can be executed at any platform.

The secret power is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). There are JVMs designed for most of platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) that compile the bytecodes (pre-compiled Java code) for the Operational System (OS).

Because of it's characteristics, we can say that with Java you can "write once and run anywhere".
